Getting Clafer Tools
--------------------

Binary distributions of the release 0.3.5 of Clafer Tools for Windows, Mac, and Linux, 
can be downloaded from [Clafer Tools - Binary Distributions](http://http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/clafer-tools-binary-distributions). 
Clafer Wiki requires Haskell Platform and MinGW to run on Windows. 

In case these binaries do not work on your particular machine configuration, the tools can be built from source code, as described below.

Installation
------------

The platform should be installed as a Git submodule into `Server/commons` folder of ClaferIDE, ClaferConfigurator, and ClaferMooVisualizer.

1. in `Server/commons` execute
	* `git submodule init`
	* `git submodule update`
2. configure the relevant options in `Server/Client/configuration.js`

Upgrading to the latest platform
--------------------------------

1. in `Server/commons` execute
	* `git submodule foreach git pull`

### Important: Branches must correspond

All related projects are following the *simultaneous release model*. 
The branch `master` contains releases, whereas the branch `develop` contains code under development. 
When building the tools, the branches should match.
Releases from branches 'master` are guaranteed to work well together.
Development versions from branches `develop` should work well together but this might not always be the case.
