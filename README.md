===========================

v0.3.6.1

A superset platform used as a submodule by all the three Clafer Web Tools: [ClaferIDE](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferIDE), [ClaferMooVisualizer](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferMooVisalizer) and [ClaferConfigurator](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferConfigurator).

Getting Clafer Tools
--------------------

Binary distributions of the release 0.3.6.1 of Clafer Tools for Windows, Mac, and Linux, 
can be downloaded from [Clafer Tools - Binary Distributions](http://http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/clafer-tools-binary-distributions). 

Installation
------------

The platform should be installed as a Git submodule into `Server/commons` folder of [ClaferIDE](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferIDE), [ClaferMooVisualizer](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferMooVisalizer), and [ClaferConfigurator](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferConfigurator).

1. in the root folder of the host project, execute
	* `git submodule init`
	* `git submodule update`
	* `git submodule foreach checkout master`

2. in the host project's source files, you can use the capabilities, components and functions of the platform. See files named `Server/Client/configuration.js` of the three listed projects as examples.

Upgrading to the latest platform
--------------------------------

* In your project folder, execute
	* `git submodule foreach pull`

The changes will be pulled and merged into your local repository.

Commiting changes made to the platform
--------------------------------

If you make changes to the files in `Server/commons` folder, you can save them into the platform.

* In your project folder, execute
	* `git submodule foreach add .`
	* `git submodule foreach commit -m "<commit message>"` 
	* `git submodule foreach push`

After that, your chagnes to the platform will be saved online. Then, you can propagate changes to the rest of the tools by following the `Upgrading to the latest platform` steps described above.

### Important: Branches must correspond

All related projects are following the *simultaneous release model*. 
The branch `master` contains releases, whereas the branch `develop` contains code under development. 
When building the tools, the branches should match.
Releases from branches `master` are guaranteed to work well together.
Development versions from branches `develop` should work well together but this might not always be the case.
